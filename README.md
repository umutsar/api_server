# api_creating
You can create api with this code. Created with python.  I used the Flask. 

0.0.0.0 means localhost.

Change port number if you want. However, dont use already used port number like (20, 21, 22, 53, 80, 443...)

Don't forget port forwarding if you dont use remote server.

If you use remote server as VPS server, upload this files and install Flask library.
|-> pip install Flask

If you want to try this code, run python file and enter this url '0.0.0.0:1234/get_data'
